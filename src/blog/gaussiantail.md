title: "Tail function of the multivariate Gaussian distribution"

As one often does, I was wondering what an $N$-dimensional generalisation of the Gaussian tail function is.

### The result

For a distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ and an affine hyperplane $\{w, b\}$, the portion of distribution to the right of the hyperplane is $H\left(\frac{-b-w\cdot \mu}{\sqrt{w^T\Sigma w}}\right)$.

### Derivation

The *tail function* of a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ is defined as

$$
H(x) = \int_x^\infty \frac{ds}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{s^2}{2}\right),
$$

and it quantifies the volume of the distribution that lies to the right of the value $x$.


Let us consider a hyperplane defined by $w \in \mathbb{R}^N$ and a bias value $b\in\mathbb{R}$.
Together, they define an affine subspace that may be thought of as a separator.
We are interested in how much of the multivariate Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ lies on one side of this subspace.

Let us call this quantity $V$, which we expect to be a function of the affine subspace $\{w, b\}$ as well as of the distribution parameters $\{\mu, \Sigma\}$.
We can compute $V$ as follows:

$$
V(w, b, \mu, \Sigma) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{d^Nx}{(2\pi)^{-N/2}\sqrt{\det \Sigma}} \theta(x\cdot w + b) \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} (x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)\right).
$$

The Heaviside Theta acts as a sort of indicator function, specifying which part of the domain $\mathbb{R}^N$ we are actually interested in, while the Gaussian part weights this portion by the appropriate amount.
Now, the trick is to consider the following expression for the Heaviside Theta:

$$
\Theta(x+\alpha) = \int_{-\alpha}^{\infty} \frac{d\lambda}{2\pi} \int d\gamma \exp(i \gamma (\lambda - x)).
$$

I like to think of this expression as a "stack of Dirac deltas" extending over the range where the argument of the Theta function is positive, that is, $x\in(-\alpha, \infty)$.

The overall formula becomes

$$
V(w, b, \mu, \Sigma) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{d^Nx}{(2\pi)^{-N/2}\sqrt{\det \Sigma}} \int_{-b}^{\infty} \frac{d\lambda}{2\pi} \int d\gamma \exp(i \gamma (\lambda - x\cdot w)) \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} (x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)\right).
$$

It is now just a matter of Gaussian integration.
Starting first from the $x$, and changing integration variable to $z = x-\mu$, we obtain

$$
V(w, b, \mu, \Sigma) = \int_{-b}^{\infty} \frac{d\lambda}{2\pi} \int d\gamma \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 (w^T\Sigma w) + i \gamma (\lambda - w\cdot \mu)\right).
$$

Now we integrate over $\gamma$, obtaining

$$
V(w, b, \mu, \Sigma) = \int_{-b}^{\infty} \frac{d\lambda}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{w^T\Sigma w}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\lambda - w\cdot \mu}{\sqrt{w^T\Sigma w}}\right)^2\right).
$$

Changing variable to $s = \frac{\lambda - w\cdot \mu}{\sqrt{w^T\Sigma w}}$, we obtain the formula

$$
V(w, b, \mu, \Sigma) = \int_{\frac{-b-w\cdot \mu}{\sqrt{w^T\Sigma w}}}^{\infty} \frac{ds}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{s^2}{2}\right) = H\left(\frac{-b-w\cdot \mu}{\sqrt{w^T\Sigma w}}\right),
$$

which is the final result.

### Disclaimer

There is probably a much cleaner derivation that makes use of affine transformations to turn a general $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ Multivariate Gaussian into a more wieldy $\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma')$.

### Code check

Here's a quick JAX-based implementation to check that the results make sense.

```python
"""Multivariate tail function"""
from jax import numpy as jnp, random as jr
from jax.scipy.special import erf


def H(x):
    return .5*(1-erf(x/jnp.sqrt(2)))


N = int(1e5)
D = 2  # dimension
SEED = 126
RNG = jr.PRNGKey(SEED)


# define parameters of Gaussian
RNG, cov_key, mean_key = jr.split(RNG, num=3)
mean = jr.normal(mean_key, shape=(D,))
precov = jr.normal(cov_key, shape=(D, D))
cov = precov @ precov.T  # making sure the cov is (at least) PSD
# define separator
RNG, w_key = jr.split(RNG)
(b, *w) = jr.normal(w_key, shape=(D+1,))
w = jnp.array(w)


# sample from this gaussian
RNG, p_key = jr.split(RNG)
points = jr.multivariate_normal(p_key, mean=mean, cov=cov, shape=(N, ))


# experimental fraction
emp = jnp.mean(points @ w + b > 0)
theory = H((-b-w@mean)/jnp.sqrt(jnp.einsum('i,ij,j', w, cov, w)))
print(f"Empirical: {emp}\nTheory: {theory}")
```
